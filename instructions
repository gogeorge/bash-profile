*This can only be installed If you have a platform which runs on macOS like a macbook/iMac
*This profile works best on a black background and green text theme. You can customize your theme by going to Terminal > Preferences

1.) open terminal and type the following:

nano ~/.bash_profile

*if it doesn't work you can just type your name as well after '_profile'

2.)Then copy paste the code from the other file here named 'source'

3.) press ctrl + o (to save the file), then enter and then ctrl + x to exit the nano editor

4.) To enable the profile type the following:

source ~/.bash_profile

*if you previously entered your name you have to do the same here too.
